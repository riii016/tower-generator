# Tower Generator (C++)

## Overview

This project is a menu-driven console application that generates ASCII towers of varying heights and patterns based on user input.

The application allows users to create:

- Single towers
- Ascending and descending tower sequences
- Repeated tower patterns

This project demonstrates nested loops, menu systems, and pattern generation.
